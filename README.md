# prework-study-guide

## Description

This website was built by a KU student as an educational project in preperation for the KU coding bootcamp. The webpage is a simple and bare-boned structure purely designed for basic educational experience, and contains notes taken regarding what I learned for future reference during the bootcamp. Through the creation of this webpage, I gained a grasp of the beginer concepts of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. That basic understanding should help me through the process of completing the bootcamp and earning my certificate. Thank you to all of the KU staff who will be teaching, and assisting me through the next six months of this course.
