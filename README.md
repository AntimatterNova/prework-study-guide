# prework-study-guide

## Description

This website was built by a KU student as an educational project in preperation for the KU coding bootcamp. The webpage is a simple and bare-boned structure purely designed for basic educational experience, and contains notes taken regarding what I learned for future reference during the bootcamp. Through the creation of this webpage, I gained a grasp of the beginer concepts of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. That basic understanding should help me through the process of completing the bootcamp and earning my certificate. Thank you to all of the KU staff who will be teaching, and assisting me through the next six months of this course.

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

## Installation

N/A

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

This site is designed as a way to host class notes in an online format. There are four clearly marked topics with related notes contained in each topic box. For help deciding on what topic to study, you can access the randomized selector in the DevTool by pressing Command+Option+I for MacOS, or with Control+Shift+I for WindowsOS.

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

## Credits

N/A

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
